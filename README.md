**MessageEncoder**
Overview

MessageEncoder is a simple Python tool that allows users to encode and decode messages by reversing the text and adding random characters for an extra layer of fun. 

**Features**

1. Encoding: Reverses the input message and adds random characters to the beginning and end if the message is longer than three characters.
2. Decoding: Removes the added random characters (if any) and restores the original message by reversing it.


**How to Use**

1. Run the program.
2. Select E to encode a message or D to decode a message.
3. Enter the message you wish to encode or decode:
4. The program will display the encoded or decoded result.
5. Press q to quit the program.

Example 1:

            Please enter 'E' for Encoding And 'D' For decoding (Press 'q' to break): E
            Enter the message: hello
            Encoded message: 9p0olleh9p0
Example 2:


            Please enter 'E' for Encoding And 'D' For decoding (Press 'q' to break): D
            Enter the message: 9p0olleh9p0
            Decoded message: hello
