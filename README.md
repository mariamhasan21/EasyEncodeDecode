MessageEncoder is a simple Python tool that allows users to encode and decode messages by reversing the text and adding random characters for an extra layer of fun. Whether you're looking for a fun way to scramble messages or create simple secret codes, this tool is a quick and easy solution!
Features

    Encoding: Reverses the input message and adds random characters to the beginning and end if the message is longer than three characters.

    User-friendly interface with easy-to-follow prompts.
